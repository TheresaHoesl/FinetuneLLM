# FinetuneLLM

In this repo an existing pre-trained large language model gets finetuned on the 'mlabonne/FineTome-100k' data set using LoRA adaptation.

* Lab2: the "unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct" model gets fine-tuned and saved at "huggingface/sreyanghosh/lora_model".
* Lab2_inference: using gradio, an UI is created and one can chat with the model.
